BuDoBase is a datamanagement-solution for summercamps.
It is meant to make the work of trainers easier to open up more ressources to work with the children and teenagers in the camp,
rather than to have to deal with excel-sheets.

It is built on Django and Bootstrap and accepts an Excel-File with information about the kids to populate the database.
The application is built so that trainers can create different groups of children,
check children in and out if they are not in camp and alter information.

It's also possibile to include a list of important places with their GPS-coordinates or a Google-Maps Link.

Features under development:
- Detect phone numbers
- Dark mode
- New Design
